**Main part**

The main part consists mainly of asanas and fitball exercises. Different studios practice their complex. Let's get acquainted with the main positions:

1. Warrior pose. Standing position, legs are shifted close, hands are located along the body. A long lunge is made with the right foot. Hands are thrown out in parallel, then rise and join above the head. In this position, a pause is made for a few seconds. Next, the muscles of the extended leg are stretched. It returns to the starting position. You need to do the same with the other leg.
2. Chair. The position is quiet. The legs are moved together. Slowly bend your knees, then squat, imitating landing on a chair. We stretch our hands up. We keep the lower back straight. We fix this position for 3-5 seconds. We sway on half-bent legs. We return to the starting position. We do this several times.
3. A boat. Lying position, arms along the body. Raise the legs and upper body together to an attainable angle. We hold our hands in front of us. We remain in this position for a comfortable time. We slowly return to the starting position.
4. Dog posture. From a standing position, slowly bend down, put your palms on the mat. We step back a little and raise the pelvis. A triangle is formed. The head is below the elbows. It is necessary that the weight is evenly distributed between the upper and lower parts of the body - then you will feel the comfort of the pose. This relieves tension from the shoulders, back, but loads the legs, which will become slimmer.
5. Savasana. With this position, the training ends. It helps to completely relax, relieve the tension of individual muscles that have become enslaved. Lie on your back on the mat, spread your arms helplessly, spread your legs to a comfortable distance. Close your eyes, feel the sweet languor. Sharply activate all the muscles, then relax.
